# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/animations/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-variant files of
  # the same image, specified with a width and height followed by a slash.
  # For example, the following are resolution-variant files for the same
  # image:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpg
  #   - images/a_dot_burr@2x.jpg
  #   - images/a_dot_burr@3x.jpg
  # By including all variants, the loader will be able to load different
  # resolutions of the same image, based on the device's device pixel ratio.
  # A resolution-variant file is defined as:
  #   - <asset-name>.<device-pixel-ratio>.png
  # For example, the following are resolution-variant files for the same
  # image:
  #   - icons/heart.png
  #   - icons/heart@2x.png
  #   - icons/heart@3x.png
  # The following assets are available to the current package:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpg
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list of font descriptors specifying the font files to load.
  # For example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
